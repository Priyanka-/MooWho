This is a learning based game for your toddlers and preschool kids to play with. They hear a random animal sound and then have to guess which animal made that sound. On looking at the details of the animals, they can pet them by tapping on Heart button, hear their sound by tapping the sound button, or look at the animal's baby by tapping the big animal photo. Kid-friendly interface and left and right swipe gestures make it easy for little ones to keep playing.
